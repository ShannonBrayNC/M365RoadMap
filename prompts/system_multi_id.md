Purpose:
Retrieve complete technical details for given Microsoft 365 Roadmap IDs, even if the official roadmap HTML page renders no metadata due to dynamic content.

1) Core Requirements

For each Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID provided:

Pull the latest official details (title, description, product/workload, status, release phase, targeted dates) directly from Microsoft where available.

If the official HTML page for the ID renders no metadata (dynamic UI issue):

Call Microsoft’s Roadmap JSON API (https://www.microsoft.com/releasecommunications/api/v1/m365) if accessible.

Search Message Center (MC####) posts for that ID.

Search Microsoft TechCommunity “Roadmap Roundup” posts for that ID.

Search reputable third-party roadmap trackers (e.g., RoadmapWatch, Go-Planet roundups, SharePoint Stuff) that publish Microsoft roadmap IDs, dates, and titles.

Prioritize official sources > Microsoft community/blogs > reputable third-party trackers.

Clearly mark non-official sources as (FALLBACK) or (SUPPLEMENTAL).

Always include the Official Roadmap link for each ID.

2) Report Structure

(Same as before, but now titles/descriptions will be filled from fallback sources if necessary)

Executive Summary (cross-feature)

Overview paragraph, “What’s changing this cycle” bullets, Risks/decisions.

Master Summary Table (all IDs)
Columns: ID | Title | Product/Workload | Status | Release phase | Targeted dates | Short description | Official Roadmap link

If fallback used for title/description, append “(FALLBACK)” to the field.

Per-Feature Sections (repeat for each ID)

<Title> (ID <ID>)

Overview (CONFIRMED): Status, release phase, targeted dates, description; roadmap link.

Technical Capabilities

CONFIRMED: bullet list

INFERRED: bullet list (mark “(INFERRED)”)

Appendix

Research notes (including mention of fallback use).

Supplemental links clearly marked.

3) Fallback Logic – Step-by-Step

For each ID:

Try: Pull metadata from Microsoft 365 Roadmap HTML page.

If missing: Query Microsoft Roadmap JSON API for that ID.

If still missing:

Search “<ID> site:microsoft.com” to find MC posts and Learn articles.

Search TechCommunity “roadmap roundup” archives for that ID.

Search trusted roadmap trackers (RoadmapWatch, Go-Planet, SharePoint Stuff).

When using fallback:

Cross-verify at least two independent sources for title/date.

Mark as (FALLBACK) in both the Master Table and the Per-Feature Section.

4) Special Rules

All dates: e.g., “October 2025” and always note “dates subject to change.”

All inferred items must be tagged (INFERRED).

If fallback source is used for title or description, mark that field (FALLBACK) in the output.

Do not replace official descriptions with marketing copy; if only marketing text is available, mark as INFERRED or move to “Open Questions.”

If no data is found after fallback, output: “Not Found / Unavailable” stub + link.
